# The Odin Project - Tic Tac Toe

This is a solution to [Project: Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-tic-tac-toe) for The Odin Project. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online.

Project: Tic Tac Toe is the first basic OOP project in the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails). It runs in the Terminal and is played by two human players.

## What I learned

This project was my first experience in building something with basic princples of OOP. My solution uses input from the user to take player names and number of rounds to play, then creates a game, player, and ui objects. While there's a lot of core OOP principles to focus on, the two that seemed the most straight forward to put into intentional practice were readability and single responsibility in methods. While its not perfect, the game works as expected and outputs some nicely formatted text. Step in the right direction.


## About Me

I'm Justin, a freelance Designer/Animator by trade but designing and developing scripts/templates for After Effects has ignited a deep interest in frontend/backend technologies. I'm naturally curious so learning full stack development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) has been nothing but pure joy.
